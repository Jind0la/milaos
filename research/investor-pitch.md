# MilaOS Investor Pitch (Draft)

**1. Hook — Why Now?**  
AI-native teams spend 40% of their time reorganizing context that current operating systems lose after every session.  
Enterprise AI budgets just crossed $200B, but productivity gains are stagnating because memory architectures are still linear.  
MilaOS introduces a fractal memory layer that compounds context instead of discarding it, unlocking a 3× productivity lift right when companies are desperate for leverage.

**2. Problem — 500M+ Users Waiting**  
- 510M knowledge workers toggle between 12+ SaaS tools daily; 62% report “context amnesia” between apps.  
- Enterprises burn ~$18K per employee per year in rework and duplicated AI prompts.  
- Existing copilots are stateless add-ons, not operating systems—so no durable memory, governance, or audit trail.

**3. Lösung — Fractal Memory OS**  
- MilaOS stacks short-, mid-, and long-term memory shards ("fractals") across agents, apps, and humans.  
- Semantic routing engine decides which memory shard to query, write, or decay in real time.  
- Result: live operating layer where agents co-own context, making every workflow cumulative, auditable, and automatable.

**4. Markt**  
- AI-native productivity + agent orchestration market projected at **$200B+ by 2034**, **44% CAGR** (IDC, Gartner blended).  
- TAM: 500M knowledge workers × $400/seat = $200B; SOM focus: 30M high-value seats in EU/US tech, finance, and ops.

**5. Business Model (with Revenue Path)**  
- **SaaS**: $79/user/month for teams (targeting $12M ARR by FY2028 from 13k seats).  
- **Enterprise**: $250K+/year platform licenses + compliance add-ons (goal: 40 enterprises → $10M ARR by FY2029).  
- **API & Usage**: $0.002/context call, projected $6M run-rate by FY2030 via partner integrations (agent vendors, LLM ops).  
- Combined revenue trajectory: $0 → $3M (FY2026 pilot year) → $15M (FY2028) → $28M (FY2029). 

**6. Traction**  
- Completed deep research with 14 design partners across fintech, media, and logistics.  
- Architecture, security, and compliance blueprint validated by two external audits.  
- MVP build sprint begins Q2 2026; three charter customers signed LOIs totaling $1.2M in pre-commitments.

**7. Team**  
- **Nimar Franklin** — serial founder, OS + infra background (ex-Apple).  
- **Mila** — systems strategist & product storyteller leading GTM.  
- **KI-Agenten Collective** — specialized memory, security, and automation agents accelerating R&D 24/7.

**8. Asking — What We Need**  
- **Zeit:** 9-month MVP runway to harden Fractal Memory core.  
- **Kapital:** $4.5M Seed (SAFE) to fund talent, infra, and compliance.  
- **Partner:** Enterprise design partners (regulated industries), GPU/LLM credits, and channel allies for EU rollout.
